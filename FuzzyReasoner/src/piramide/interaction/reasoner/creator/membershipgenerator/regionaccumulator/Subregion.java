	 * Take as an example the following data:
	 * 
	 *   value 0.0 -> trends 2.0
	 *   value 1.0 -> trends 2.0
	 *   value 2.0 -> trends 2.0
	 *   value 3.0 -> trends 2.0
	 *   
	 * In proportions, this means:
	 * 
	 *   value 0.0 -> trends 25%
	 *   value 1.0 -> trends 25%
	 *   value 2.0 -> trends 25%
	 *   value 3.0 -> trends 25%
	 *   
	 * Calculating the accumulation of the trend values, we can get:
	 * 
	 *   value 0.0 -> accumulated 25%
	 *   value 1.0 -> accumulated 50%
	 *   value 2.0 -> accumulated 75%
	 *   value 3.0 -> accumulated 100%
	 *
	 * However, we need to represent that with value 0.0, the membership 
	 * function is 0.0. We can therefore use the following trend values: 
	 * 
	 *   value 0.0 -> accumulated 0%
	 *   value 1.0 -> accumulated 25%
	 *   value 2.0 -> accumulated 50%
	 *   value 3.0 -> accumulated 75%
	 *
	 * This approach is also not valid, since we want that with value 3.0, the
	 * membership function to be 100%.
	 * 
	 * In order to fix this problem, we take both points, calling them 
	 * "higher point" and "lower point":
	 * 
	 *   value 0.0 -> lower  0%, higher  25%
	 *   value 1.0 -> lower 25%, higher  50%
	 *   value 2.0 -> lower 50%, higher  75%
	 *   value 3.0 -> lower 75%, higher 100%
	 *
	 * Given any value, it will be in a position between the maximum value (3.0)
	 * and the minimum value (0.0). This position represents a percent of the 
	 * distance covered by the maximum and the minimum value. For instance, 1.0 is
	 * in the 33% of the distance covered by 0.0 and 3.0.
	 * 
	 * Given this proportion inside the X axis (being X = value; Y = regression 
	 * trend value we are looking for), we know that the point we are looking for
	 * is exactly in that proportion between the "lower point" and the "higher point":
	 * 
	 *   value 0.0 -> proportion   0%. lower  0%, higher  25%. regression:   0.0%
	 *   value 1.0 -> proportion  33%. lower 25%, higher  50%. regression:  33.3%
	 *   value 2.0 -> proportion  66%. lower 50%, higher  75%. regression:  66.6%
	 *   value 3.0 -> proportion 100%. lower 75%, higher 100%. regression: 100.0%
	 *
	 * Being 
	 * 
	 *    regression = lower + proportion * (higher - lower) 
	 *
	 * If the function is a curve, it doesn't matter, since both curves are equidistant.
